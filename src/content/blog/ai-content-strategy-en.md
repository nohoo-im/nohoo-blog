Many people misunderstand AI writing: they think it's about throwing a task to ChatGPT and publishing directly.

The result? Homogenized content that readers can spot as AI-generated instantly.

A real AI content strategy treats AI as your collaborator, not your replacement.

## My Workflow

### Step 1: Human Sets the Direction

Every week I spend 2 hours on content planning:

- Determine this week's themes
- List the core messages I want to convey
- Collect relevant cases and data

This step must be done manually. AI can help you execute, but you must control the direction.

### Step 2: AI Expansion

Use nohoo.im to expand ideas into drafts:

- Provide clear prompts and context
- Let AI generate multiple versions
- Choose the one closest to your style

### Step 3: Human Polish

After the draft is ready, I:

- Remove all "firstly," "secondly," "in conclusion"
- Add personal experiences and opinions
- Adjust the tone to make it sound like "me"

### Step 4: Multi-platform Adaptation

The same content needs different presentations on different platforms:

- Blog: Long-form, in-depth
- Twitter/X: Quotes, fragments
- LinkedIn: Professional, insights

nohoo.im can generate multiple versions with one click.

## Efficiency Gains

Using this method, my content output went from 1 piece per week to 5 pieces per week, without sacrificing quality.

The key isn't how powerful AI is, but how you use it.
