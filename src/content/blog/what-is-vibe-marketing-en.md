Vibe Marketing is not a methodology. It's a state.

When you use AI tools proficiently enough, marketing work enters a flow state—ideas flow directly into execution, execution flows directly into results.

## The Essence of Vibe Marketing

Traditional marketing work:

1. Have an idea
2. Organize into a document
3. Communicate with the team
4. Wait for execution
5. Check results
6. Iterate

Vibe Marketing:

1. Have an idea
2. Execute with AI
3. See results

Sounds simple? The key lies in the "execute with AI" step.
